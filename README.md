To run Tester.pl do the following steps...
  1. Open SWI-Prolog
  2. cd into the working directory, ex: cd('C:\\Users\\capta\\OneDrive\\Documents\\CSE 465\\Homework 3').
  3. Check if the directory is correct by using ls. These three files should be included -> hw3.pl         Tester.pl      zipcodes.pl
  4. Consult Tester.pl by using consult('Tester.pl').

The output can then be compared with the expected values commented in file to test if the code is functioning correctly!
